# why we need reserved word in java?

Reserved words in Java are words that are predefined by the language for some special purpose or functionality.

They cannot be used as identifiers, such as variable names, class names, or method names. Using a reserved word as an identifier would cause an error or unexpected result.

Java has around 50 keywords and 3 literals as reserved words.

Some examples of reserved words are `abstract`, `boolean`, `class`, `if`, `null`, and `true`.

These words are used to represent some meaning and functionality in the Java programming language.

# What is the difference between a keyword and an identifier?

In Java, a keyword is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning in the language and cannot be used as an identifier.
An identifier, on the other hand, is a name given to variables, classes, methods, etc. and can be chosen by the programmer.
	
**For example**, `int` is a keyword that indicates that a variable is of integer type, while `score` is an identifier that can be used as the name of a variable.
	 
Keywords are part of the Java programming language syntax and cannot be used as variable names or for any other purpose.
Identifiers must follow certain rules, such as not being a keyword, not starting with a digit, and not containing whitespace.

# How many keywords are there in Java?

According to the information I found, there are **67 reserved words** in the Java programming language. Of these 67 keywords, 16 of them are only contextually reserved,
and can sometimes be used as an  identifier, unlike standard reserved words.
	
These keywords have a predefined meaning in the language and cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers.

# How many literals are there in java?

In Java, there are **6 kinds** of literals: **Boolean**, **integer**, **character**, **string**, and **floating-point** literals. These literals represent constant values that can be assigned to variables in a program. For example, the number `1` is an integer literal, the text `"Hello"` is a string literal, and the value `true` is a Boolean literal.

# What is the difference between a literal and a variable?

In Java, a variable is a named location in memory that can store a value.

The value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program.

A literal, on the other hand, is a fixed value that is directly represented in the source code.

For example, in the statement `int x = 5;`, `x` is a variable and `5` is an integer literal.

The value of the variable `x` can be changed later in the program, but the value of the literal `5` remains constant.
