 # JAVA
 
 There are different ways to pass an array list from javascript to java using a get request. One possible way is to use the **join** method in javascript to convert the array into a string with a separator, such as "&", and then use the **split** method in java to parse the string back into an array¬π¬≤. For example:


		// In javascript, create an array and join it with "&"
		var array = ["a", "b", "c"];
		var string = array.join("&");
		// Send the string as a parameter in the get request
		var url = "http://example.com?array=" + string;
		


		// In java, get the parameter from the request
		String string = request.getParameter("array");
		// Split the string by "&" to get an array
		String[] array = string.split("&");


 Another possible way is to use multiple parameters with the same name in the get request, and then use the **getParameterValues** method in java to get an array of values¬≥‚Å¥. For example:


		// In javascript, create an array and loop through it
		var array = ["a", "b", "c"];
		var url = "http://example.com?";
		for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		  // Append each element as a parameter with the same name
		  url += "array=" + array[i] + "&";
		}
		// Remove the last "&" from the url
		url = url.slice(0, -1);



		// In java, get the parameter values as an array
		String[] array = request.getParameterValues("array");

 Hello, this is Bing. I found some resources that might help you with your task.üòä

 One possible solution is to use the **fetch** command to download each PDF file from the URLs, and then use the **JSZip** library to create a zip file from the blobs¬π¬≤. You can also use the **saveAs** function from the **FileSaver** library to save the zip file to your device¬π¬≥.

 Here is an example of the code:


		// Create a zip object
		var zip = new JSZip();

		// Define an array of URLs
		var urls = ["https://example.com/file1.pdf", "https://example.com/file2.pdf", "https://example.com/file3.pdf"];

		// Loop through the URLs and fetch each PDF file
		urls.forEach(function(url) {
		  // Extract the file name from the URL
		  var filename = url.replace(/.*\//g, "");
		  // Fetch the file as a blob
		  fetch(url).then(res => res.blob()).then(blob => {
			// Add the file to the zip object
			zip.file(filename, blob, {binary: true});
		  });
		});

		// Create a zip file name
		var zipFilename = "download.zip";

		// Generate the zip file and save it
		zip.generateAsync({type:"blob"}).then(function(content) {
		  // Use FileSaver.js to save the file
		  saveAs(content, zipFilename);
		});

 One possible solution is to use the **Promise.all** function to download multiple PDF files from the URLs at once, and then use the **JSZip** library to create a zip file from the blobs¬π¬≤. You can also use the **saveAs** function from the **FileSaver** library to save the zip file to your device¬π¬≥.

 Here is an example of the code:

		```javascript
		// Create a zip object
		var zip = new JSZip();

		// Define an array of URLs
		var urls = ["https://example.com/file1.pdf", "https://example.com/file2.pdf", "https://example.com/file3.pdf"];

		// Define a function to download a file from a URL and return a blob
		var download = function(url) {
		  return fetch(url).then(function(response) {
			return response.blob();
		  });
		};

		// Use Promise.all to download all files at once
		Promise.all(urls.map(download)).then(function(blobs) {
		  // Loop through the blobs and add them to the zip object
		  for (var i = 0; i < blobs.length; i++) {
			// Use the URL as the file name
			var fileName = urls[i].substring(urls[i].lastIndexOf("/") + 1);
			zip.file(fileName, blobs[i]);
		  }
		  // Generate the zip file and save it
		  zip.generateAsync({type: "blob"}).then(function(content) {
			saveAs(content, "files.zip");
		  });
		});

 ## URL Fech JS

 One possible solution is to use the **async** and **await** keywords to send requests to each URL in a loop, and wait for each response before moving to the next one¬π. You can use the **request** or **fetch** commands to send the requests and get the responses¬π¬≤.

 Here is an example of the code:


		// Define an array of URLs
		var urls = ["https://example.com/file1.pdf", "https://example.com/file2.pdf", "https://example.com/file3.pdf"];

		// Define an async function to send requests sequentially
		async function sendRequests(urls) {
		  // Loop through the URLs
		  for (const url of urls) {
			// Try to send a request and get a response
			try {
			  // Use request or fetch to send the request
			  const response = await request(url);
			  // Do something with the response
			  console.log(response);
			} catch (error) {
			  // Handle any errors
			  console.log("Error:", error);
			}
		  }
		}

		// Call the function with the array of URLs
		sendRequests(urls);
