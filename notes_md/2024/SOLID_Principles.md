The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This makes the class easier to understand, test, and maintain.
   
   ```java
   public class Book {
       private String name;
       private String author;
       private String text;

       // Constructor, getters, and setters
   }
   ```

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without changing existing code.
   
   ```java
   public abstract class Shape {
       abstract void draw();
   }

   public class Circle extends Shape {
       @Override
       void draw() {
           // Draw circle
       }
   }

   public class Square extends Shape {
       @Override
       void draw() {
           // Draw square
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass.
   
   ```java
   public class Bird {
       public void fly() {
           // Fly
       }
   }

   public class Sparrow extends Bird {
       @Override
       public void fly() {
           // Fly like a sparrow
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface.
   
   ```java
   public interface Printer {
       void print();
   }

   public interface Scanner {
       void scan();
   }

   public class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printer, Scanner {
       @Override
       public void print() {
           // Print
       }

       @Override
       public void scan() {
           // Scan
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   
   ```java
   public interface Keyboard {
       void type();
   }

   public class MechanicalKeyboard implements Keyboard {
       @Override
       public void type() {
           // Type with mechanical keyboard
       }
   }

   public class Computer {
       private Keyboard keyboard;

       public Computer(Keyboard keyboard) {
           this.keyboard = keyboard;
       }

       public void type() {
           keyboard.type();
       }
   }
   ```

These principles help in building robust, extensible, and maintainable software¹²³.
